The goals of the workshop are to: <p>

Share existing inclusive XR solutions that will help us create new standards for inclusive XR on the web. <br>
Identify accessibility gaps in existing web XR technologies, and consider solutions for closing those gaps.<br>
Explore ways to use existing technologies and standards to create innovative solutions for inclusive XR on the web.<br>
Expected topics of discussion include: <p>

<ul>
	<li>Standards that already exist or are in development that may impact inclusive XR on the web</li>
	<li>Solutions that are already being used to create inclusive XR on the web</li>
	<li>Lessons from other areas like location-based VR, gaming, and 360 video</li>
	<li>Accessibility limitations of existing web XR technologies</li>
	<li>Extensions to existing web XR technologies to enable more inclusive XR on the web </li>
	<li>Role of AI in providing real-time audio description or text captions </li>
	<li>Using existing APIs to provide alternative modes of interaction (like the Vibration API for tactile feedback, the Gamepad API for alternative input devices) </li>
<ul>
